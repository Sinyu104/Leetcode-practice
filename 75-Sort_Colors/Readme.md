## Discussion of solution

- My first thought:
    - Do the travelsal and count how many is the **0's, 1's, 2's**
    - Do the travel again and change the value of element

- solution :
    - Use two variable to memory the position of _0 and 2_
    - exchange the two position 
    - **Remember when switching 2 should do _i--_**
