## Discussion of solution

- solution 1:
    - When we try to detect a circle in the link list, we need to mark the node that we have visited.
    - *This may change the value in the list node.*

- solution 2:
    - This solution is using the _slow and fast pointer_
    - But this is using when _fast and slow_ pointer meets.
