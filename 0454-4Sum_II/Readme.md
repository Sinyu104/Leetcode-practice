It takes me a lot of time to solve this question.
Of course, you can do it by **4 nested for-loop**

    > And O(1) space complexity

- this solution is solve by the concept **_A+B+C+D=0 == A+B=-(C+D)_** 
    - put both A+B and -(C+D) in to the map 
    - The time complexity will be O(2 n^2)
    - But space complexity will be O(n^2)
